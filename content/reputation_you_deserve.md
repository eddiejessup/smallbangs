It's hard to determine the stability of a plate while you're eating off it. For about two years, every morning I ate poached eggs for breakfast. Whether it's my nostalgia, or it was my state, or the food, I remember the eggs tasting better than I've tasted since. I associate my breakfast routine strongly with meaningful segments of my past few years. Now, I don't eat breakfast; maybe this will gain meaning later.

My memory deals with finer grains than breakfast type though. In the middle of the poached egg period, I was summarising my PhD, in a supposed squalid little hell-hole, to force myself to finish the document. My flat was really a four month let in an elegant Edinburgh tenement, overlooking the cascading mundanity of the lesser meadows, and a CostCutter. I'd aimed at squalor, smallness and torment as a venue for my battle with the thesis, as a reason not to work for the two prior months: my funding had gone, so I decided the flat I'd previously considered home had sapped my momentum. Squalor provides squalor, but it also brings an eye-widening jolt. Furthermore, this jolt greets smallness and torment with a firm handshake and a believable grin.

My squalid room's desk was shallow.
