I'm Elliot Marsden, a PhD student working in the [Soft Matter group](http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/cmatter/soft.html) of the [Institute for Condensed Matter and Complex Systems (ICMS)](http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/cmatter), based in the [School of Physics](http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home).

My PhD involves computer simulations of various non-equilibrium active systems: systems which may be far from thermal equilibrium for sustained periods of time. These systems generally have some input of external energy, for example via conversion of chemical energy into mechanical work by biological organisms.

The work I do in particular consists of agent-based simulations of simplified models of motile bacteria in confining environments, such as two-dimensional traps, mazes, and water droplets. The non-equilibrium nature of such systems makes their behaviour difficult to predict, and complex phenomena are frequently observed.

Outside of work I spend most of my time playing around with computers, learning about languages, running around, and watching stand-up comedy.
